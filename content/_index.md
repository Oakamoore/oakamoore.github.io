I'm a game development graduate, with a primary focus
on **game programming**, with a particular interest in **UI** & **Gameplay** programming.

I'm proficient with both **C++** and **C#**, as well as **Unreal Engine** and **Unity**, though I'm always looking to broaden my knowledge and expand my skillset.

I'm currently seeking my first professional role in the games industry, as an entry level game programmer.
